Step 1- Create the directory that will store the project as well as a direnv for it.
 * mkdir folder_name
 * Go into the folder you just created and type:
   - echo "layout python3"> .envrc

Step 2- Install and load django into directory, start project.
 * pip install django
 * django-admin startproject projectname


Step 3- Create app and add it to settings.py
 * Enter the folder created by running startproject
 * ./manage.py startapp appname
 * in settings.py(in projectname directory) add the app to INSTALLED_APPS
   - ['appname']


Step 4- Migrate and create admin/superuser
 * ./manage.py migrate
 * ./manage.py createsuperuser


Step 5- Create apps models and make migrations
 * create a class in the models.py file
    class syntax: class Name(models.Model)
    variable syntax:  models.VariableType(max_datalength)
     list of field types -> https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.9/ref/models/fields/
     - When naming Class/Model use a singular term [ex. dont use stats or oxens]
 * return to the directory with ./manage.py and run ./manage.py makemigrations

 * in admin.py within the app directory:
    from appname.models import ClassName
    admin.site.register(Class)

Step 6- Make migration and add table data to file
 * ./manage.py makemigrations app will create a new file in the migrations directory
  - This is both a schema migration and safe command

 * run ./manage.py migrate to update the database
  - If no migrations to apply is returned then the database is up to date and no changes have been applied


To Run server:
 * in project directory containing manage.py
   - ./manage.py runserver
 * ctrl + c will end server
 * Copy and paste link in browser to access site
