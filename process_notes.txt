Step 1- Create the directory that will store the project as well as a direnv for it.
 * mkdir folder_name
 * echo "layout python3"> .envrc

Step 2- Install and load django into directory
 * django-admin startproject projectname

Step 3- Run server while in project directory containing manage.py
 * ./manage.py runserver
 * Copy and paste link in browser to access site

Step 5- Create app and add it to settings.py
 * ./manage.py startapp appname
 * in settings.py(in app directory) add the app to INSTALLED_APPS
   - ['appname']

Step 6- Migrate and create admin/superuser
 * ./manage.py migrate
 * ./manage.py createsuperuser
 * username = asdf
 * password = safepass

 Step 7- Create apps models and install app
 * create a class in the models.py file
    class syntax: class Name(models.Model)
    variable syntax:  models.VariableType(max_datalength)
     -(null=True) will auto input default value *DO NOT DO THIS for fields that require input
     list of field types -> https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.9/ref/models/fields/
     - When naming Class/Model use a singular term [ex. dont use stats or oxens]

 * in admin.py within the app directory:
    from appname.models import ClassName
    admin.site.register(Class)

Step 8- Make migration and add table data to file
 * ./manage.py makemigrations app will create a new file in the migrations directory
  - This is both a schema migration and safe command

 * run ./manage.py migrate to update the database
  - If no migrations to apply is returned then the database is up to date and no changes have been applied

 * Do not edit 0001, create a 0002 and edit that
   Def name_of_function(apps, schema_editor)
   Stat = apps.getmodel("app_name", "Stat")
   Class.objects.create(variablekeyword="desiredinput")

 * In operations=[] add:
    'migrations.runPython(name_of_function)'
 * run ./manage.py migrate to apply changes and make appear in database

Error notes:
    You are trying to add a non-nullable field to start without default: No data given to class attribute, hitting enter will allow
     default to be used.
